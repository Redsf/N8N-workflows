# n8n Workflow Portfolio

A collection of 63 production-style n8n automations covering AI agents, RAG knowledge systems, e-commerce operations, real estate, and HR document processing. Each workflow lives in its own folder as a ready-to-import JSON file with a README explaining what it does, how it's wired, and how to configure it.

These solve real operational problems: recovering abandoned carts, qualifying and routing leads, extracting data from invoices, answering questions with grounded AI, and keeping teams informed without manual busywork.

> **By [Redowan Ahmed Farhan](https://github.com/Redsf)** — AI Automation Engineer. Several of these workflows are the credential-free reference builds of systems I've shipped to production for clients. The numbers below are results from those live deployments.

> 🏅 **Official n8n creator** — selected workflows from this portfolio are published on n8n's template marketplace: [n8n.io/creators/redowanfarhan →](https://n8n.io/creators/redowanfarhan/)
